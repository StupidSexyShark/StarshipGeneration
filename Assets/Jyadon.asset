  storyText: 'The steel vault closes behind you. Metallic and chemical odors are replaced
    by organic dirt, pollen, and animal smells.  You are new to this world, but your
    mind is filled with ideas, images, and concepts: A tutorial of what it means to
    be a thing called "human" and how to eat, shelter, and survive.  A man stands
    in front of you, and you know what seperates you is the thing called age.  He
    must be listened to for having lived so long.'
